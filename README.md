I hate SJW. I think that all people are equal independent of race, religion, age,
degrees, sex or position.

By replacing the established terms "master" and "slave" with new inclusive terms, we
elevate some people over others.

The hacker ethics says that hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such
as degrees, age, race, sex, or position. The criteria such as age, sex, race, position,
and qualification are deemed irrelevant within the hacker community. Hacker skill is the
ultimate determinant of acceptance. Such a code within the hacker community fosters the
advance of hacking and software development. In an example of the hacker ethic of equal
opportunity, L Peter Deutsch, a twelve-year-old hacker, was accepted in the TX-0
community, though he was not recognized by non-hacker graduate students.

We are violating this principle. Political, social and other conflicts should not affect
science, information technology and other inherently apolitical spheres of human activity.

This is madness. Stop licking black asses just because they supposedly have an
inferiority complex due to something that happened a couple of hundred years ago. We are
manipulated by those who benefit from separating people on this or that basis.

Think about it.

GitHub can delete this repo and ban my account. This will only confirm my words. But I
hope people are saner than those who started it think, and this madness will end soon.
